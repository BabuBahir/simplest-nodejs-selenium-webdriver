# simplest-nodejs-selenium-webdriver


simplest of simplest hello world app for selenium webdriver on nodejs

to get this working >> node index.js

! it won't work tho :p

you need to install webdriver-manager globally ...so #npm install -g webdriver-manager


also selenium depends upon java so you need to install jdk with the jdk/bin path set in environment variables

on a separate console...start the webdriver-manager by #webdriver-manager start --standalone
this will run on port 4444 by default

now run the app #node index.js  !! bingo
